I work where people, technology, and operations meet, bridging them to support sustainable business growth.

As technology enthusiast
self-hosting | homelab | build-break-fix | from idea to setup
Outside of work, I run my own self-hosted systems, experiment with new technologies, and turn ideas into practical setups that make everyday life easier. I learn mainly by building, breaking, and fixing things. All of my GitHub projects start from personal needs and are improved by thinking about how others might use them — always with the question in mind: “What if someone else finds this useful?”
As employee
Senior Manager | Global IT Operations & OT | Digitalizing Global Operations | People-Centric Leader
IT Operations leader with nearly 20 years of experience from local infrastructure and support to Global IT Operations in production-driven environments.
As Senior Manager, Global IT Operations,  responsible for the reliability, development, and scalability of global IT infrastructure . Alongside this role, I’m expanding into the Operational Technology (OT) area, helping build structures and teams focused on the digitalization of global operations and stronger alignment between IT, OT, and the business.
I’ve spent most of my career working close to production, bridging technology, operations, and people. I prefer simple, practical solutions and steady progress — focusing on the next improvement rather than chasing perfection. I don’t see failures, only lessons that move teams forward.
My leadership style is people-centric and adaptive. I believe in team wins, collaboration, and shared responsibility for business sustainability. I work closely with individuals, respect their experience, and adjust my management approach to their stage of development, creating space for ownership, learning, and growth.
